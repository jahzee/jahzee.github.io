#+BEGIN_VERSE
Jasmine is a sticky note,
sticking with me from 2nd to 4th grade

Jasmine is a horse
with swift, long and fast legs
carrying her over the course

Jasmine is a comedian
she whips up
a whole lot of laughter
when she's near

Jasmine is a monkey
she loved to swing from tree to tree
with her long black hair trailing behind
having fun all day

But what Jasmine truly is
is my great (but skinny) friend!
