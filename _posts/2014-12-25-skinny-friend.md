   Jasmine is a sticky note,<br />
   sticking with me from 2nd to 4th grade<br />
   <br />
   Jasmine is a horse<br />
   with swift, long and fast legs<br />
   carrying her over the course<br />
   <br />
   Jasmine is a comedian<br />
   she whips up<br />
   a whole lot of laughter<br />
   when she's near<br />
   <br />


   Jasmine is a monkey<br />
   she loved to swing from tree to tree<br />
   with her long black hair trailing behind<br />
   having fun all day<br />
   <br />
   But what Jasmine truly is<br />
   is my great (but skinny) friend!<br />
