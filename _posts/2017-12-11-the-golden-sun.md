# The Golden Sun

<p class="verse">
Winter came<br />
Riding fast<br />
On bitter winds<br />
<br />
Ensnaring the sky<br />
With a net<br />
As dark as ink<br />
So that<br />
The Golden Sun<br />
Would never rise<br />
<br />
For years<br />
That canopy<br />
Of unending darkness<br />
Stood<br />
<br />
When one day<br />
The tips<br />
Of Dawn<br />
Could be seen<br />
And<br />
The Golden Sun<br />
Rose<br />
<br />
Glorious rays<br />
Forcing<br />
The darkness back<br />
Shining<br />
In full splendor<br />
And glory<br />
They painted<br />
The sky<br />
With their<br />
Golden brilliance<br />
<br />
Darkness could not<br />
Trap the sky<br />
For the sky<br />
Was home<br />
To<br />
The Golden Sun<br />
<br />
The Golden Sun,<br />
and Rose-fingered Dawn.<br />
Hand in hand,<br />
they cloaked the life-giving Earth,<br />
in crimson reds with yellow hues.<br />
<br />
Feel the crisp, refreshing wind,<br />
scatter those golden leaves,<br />
who shine so brightly,<br />
as if to match the Golden Sun.<br />
<br />
The Silver Moon,<br />
and velvety Dark Twilight.<br />
Hand in hand,<br />
they engulfed the flaming Earth,<br />
in frosted whites with icy hues.<br />
<br />
Feel the numbing, piercing wind,<br />
cut through those fragile frosted leaves,<br />
who are so brave and bold,<br />
to stand up to the harsh rule of the Silver Moon.<br />
<br />
And those brave, frosted leaves,<br />
Are swept up by the numbing wind,<br />
And lifted up to face the judgement,<br />
of the Silver Moon.<br />
<br />
And no matter how biting the glare of the Silver Moon is.<br />
And no matter how numbing the piercing wind is.<br />
Those frosted leaves shall not tremble nor bow down.<br />
They stand defiantly up to the might of the Silver Moon.<br />
<br />
As the frosted leaves braved the Silver Moon,<br />
the Golden Sun,<br />
and Rose-fingered Dawn,<br />
reached out with rays of gold,<br />
streaked with hues of red,<br />
to melt the frost,<br />
and to chase away,<br />
the Silver Moon and the Dark Twilight.<br />
<br />
And the frosted leaves,<br />
were touched by the Golden Sunâ€™s glorious rays.<br />
But so high the piercing wind had lifted them,<br />
They were caught,<br />
in the holy embrace,<br />
of the angelic clouds.<br />
