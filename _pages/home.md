## Jasmine Loves ... 

### Trixie

Jasmine was a cat fanatic.  Between YouTube cat videos, cat
screensavers and wallpaper as well as a cat calendar, Jasmine could
not get enough cat exposure.  Unfortunately, Hong Kong doctors
indicated that her home should be pet and plant free during
chemotherapy treatments.  Bacteria associated with plants and pets
could bypass her compromised immune system and infect her body.

But once her surgery and chemotherapy treatments were complete,
Jasmine's first trip was to the [Hong Kong SPCA][] to adopt a cat.
She 'interviewed' a few cats and settled on a domestic short-haired
female named Van.  Even though Van had one fang and a few molars
removed by the doctors and had a healing wound on her shoulder, her
demeanor was amiable.  Jasmine took Van home and rechristened her
Trixie.

We will never know if Trixie was named after [Knuffle Bunny][]'s owner
or because of all the tricks she played on us the first few
days. Regardless of the source, Trixie loved her new name and
reciprocated the gift by providing Jasmine with unconditional love and
endless joy.

In November 2016, Trixie struggled through a 16-hour dark plane
trip from Hong Kong to be with Jasmine in New York.  For the next
year, Trixie was a shining light in Jasmine's struggle against cancer.
[Trixie][] continues to be a lasting gift from Jasmine to her
family.

## Accomplishments

### Scratch

Jasmine enjoyed showing off her [Scratch][] coding skills to her
lassmates.  Her favorite creation was the [Cat vs Mouse][] game.
[Basketball Bonanza][] is a lot of fun too.  Give them a shot and
share your high score!

### Prezi

Jasmine created many presentations with [Prezi][].  She began with a
[timeline of her life][] documenting her major milestones through
April 2014.  In May, she made a [presentation about Steve Jobs][].
After spending the first half of her 5th grade receiving treatment at
[Queen Mary Hospital][], she returned to school and designed another
presentation about [why some languages become extinct][].

### Cally and Bean

To pass the time during chemotherapy treatments in [Queen Mary
Hospital][]'s [Children's Cancer Center][], Jasmine enjoyed reading
mystery novels.  Inspired to create her own, she wrote three stories
about best friends Cally and Bean (and a pet hamster named Nams).
After drawing the illustrations, she worked with her mother and father
to publish the stories. *Cally and Bean: Middle School Mysteries* is
available in [English][] and [Traditional Chinese][].  The book is
dedicated "For everyone in K8N" which is the pediatric cancer ward on
the North side of the 8th floor of Block K in Queen Mary Hospital.

### Taekwondo

Jasmine started taking Taekwondo lesson's at [Mok's Taekwondo
School][] under Kukkiwon Black Belt 9th Dan Grand Master Charles Mok
in January 2010.  Prior to being diagnosed with cancer in 2014,
Jasmine passed the 3rd Kup examination and btained a red stripe on her
blue belt. After months of chemotherapy and the removal of her right
fibula she regained enough strength in her leg to begin practice
again.  By August 2015 she earned her red belt and a year later -- one
month before leaving Hong Kong for the last time -- Jasmine passed the
1st Kup exam and proudly earned her black stripe on September 24,
2016.

### Center for Talented Youth

Jasmine participated in [Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth][] in
November 2015.  By scoring in the 95th percentile for quantitative
skills, she qualified for participation in the CTY programs -- both
online and in person.  As her hair grew back and she regained control
of her right ankle, she proudly attended the 2016 [award ceremony][],
walked on stage and accepted her award.

The following summer, Jasmine attended the newly created CTY Summer
camp in Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong.  She chose the Introduction to Robotics
course and spent the summer creating various robots with Lego
Mindstorms.  Her participation with the CTY program continued after
she moved back to New York.  She took advantage of their online
program and thoroughly enjoyed Scratch Programming for Middle School
Students.

## Fund Raising 

### St. Baldrick's

Jasmine is a [St. Baldrick's][] [honored kid][]. Since 2015, over
$175,000 has been raised for pediatric cancer research by [teams][]
shaving their heads bald in Jasmine's honor. All funds raised by the
events hosted at the Hong Kong International School are donated to the
Hong Kong Children's Cancer Foundation.

### MSK Kids

[MSK Kids][] [Child Life Services][] program brought Jasmine joy
during her final year in New York.  Upon her death, an outpouring of
support made [Jasmine's Giving Page][] the [top funded campaign in
2017][].  Over $147,000 has been raised to support the MSK Kids Child
Life Services program.  A [plaque][] in Jasmine's memory has been
placed in the main hall of [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center][].

### D10

Jasmine's fight caught the attention of four athletes competing in
[the D10][] to raise money for pediatric cancer research.  After
winning first place, they visited Jasmine at home and shared the good
news and trophy.  The team renamed themselves "J's Bulls", and even
though Jasmine passed away before the next year's event, they won
first place again.  An [interview with the team][] documents why they
trained so hard.  Sadly, the team captain, [Everett Cole Watson][],
[passed away][] as well, leaving the team wondering if they should
compete again.  The team renamed themselves "E-J's Bulls" in memory of
Everett and Jasmine, dug deep, and [won the competition][] with the
three remaining athletes.

## In Memory

### The Jasmine Psaris Art Award

Jasmine filled her hours (and days) at the hospital playing [video]
games, reading books and creating art.  Even before Jasmine was
diagnosed with cancer, she showed a strong enthusiasm for art class.
Between ceramic sculptures, sketching and painting, she enjoyed the
process of designing and creating.  This passion became even stronger
when she could no longer attend class with her friends.  The
monotonous hospital hours were perfect for expressing herself through
art.  Jasmine created a vast [portfolio][] of stories and art.

### Jasmine Robot

Hong Kong's [Children's Cancer Foundation][] provides caring services
for young children with cancer as well as their families.  A few
examples include the donation of books, toys, computers in the
pediatric wards of government hospital. In addition, they have donated
cots for family members to sleep on when staying at the hospital.
With the support of donations raised at Hong Kong St. Baldrick's
events, the CCF funds pediatric cancer research with the ultimate goal
of eradicating the disease.

In appreciation for everything the CCF has achieved and in support of
all Hong Kong pediatric cancer patients, the Psaris family has donated
a self-driving, two-wheeled videoconferencing robot enabling patients
to visit other children and rooms of the hospital -- even when
confined to their beds.  The ["Jasmine" robot][] became a surprise hit
when Covid-19 prevented all in-person visits.
