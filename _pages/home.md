## Jasmine Loves ... 

### Trixie

<p>Jasmine was a cat fanatic.  Between YouTube cat videos, cat
screensavers and wallpaper as well as a cat calendar, Jasmine could
not get enough cat exposure.  Unfortunately, Hong Kong doctors
indicated that her home should be pet and plant free during
chemotherapy treatments.  Bacteria associated with plants and pets
could bypass her compromised immune system and infect her body.</p>

<p>But once her surgery and chemotherapy treatments were complete,
Jasmine's first trip was to the 
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.spca.org.hk/en/">Hong Kong SPCA</a> to adopt a cat.
She 'interviewed' a few cats and settled on a domestic short-haired
female named Van.  Even though Van had one fang and a few molars
removed by the doctors and had a healing wound on her shoulder, her
demeanor was amiable.  Jasmine took Van home and rechristened her
Trixie.</p>

<p>We will never know if Trixie was named after 
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuffle_Bunny">Knuffle Bunny</a>'s
owner or because of all the tricks she played on us the first few
days. Regardless of the source, Trixie loved her new name and
reciprocated the gift by providing Jasmine with unconditional love and
endless joy.</p>

<p>In November 2016, Trixie struggled through a 16-hour dark plane trip
from Hong Kong to be with Jasmine in New York.  For the next year,
Trixie was a shining light in Jasmine's struggle against cancer.  <a class="my-link" 
href="/trixie/">Trixie</a> continues to be a lasting gift from Jasmine
to her family.</p>



## Accomplishments

### Scratch

Jasmine enjoyed showing off her <a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> 
coding skills to her classmates.  Her favorite creation was the 
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/27270597">Cat vs Mouse</a> game.  <a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/37947366/">Basketball Bonanza</a> 
is a lot of fun too.  Give them a shot and share your high score!

<h3 id="prezi">Prezi<a class="header-link" href="#prezi"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3>

Jasmine created many presentations with <a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://prezi.com">Prezi</a>.  She began 
with a <a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://prezi.com/b11vjggtgp-p/my-timeline/?present=1">timeline of her life</a> 
documenting her major milestones through April 2014.  In May, she made 
a <a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://prezi.com/1pwbj8k_kl-0/steve-jobs/?present=1">presentation about Steve Jobs</a>.  After 
spending the first half of her 5th grade receiving treatment at 
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://www8.ha.org.hk/qmh/">Queen Mary Hospital</a>, 
she returned to school and designed another presentation about 
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://prezi.com/jazichaxl0uc/why-do-languages-become-extinct/?present=1">why some languages become extinct</a>.


### Cally and Bean

To pass the time during chemotherapy treatments in 
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ha.org.hk/qmh/">Queen Mary Hospital's</a>
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://paed.hku.hk/services/public_area/service/UPAM_K8_PE_001_Ward_Info.pdf">Children's Cancer Center</a>,
Jasmine enjoyed reading mystery novels.  Inspired to create her own,
she wrote three stories about best friends Cally and Bean (and a pet
hamster named Nams).  After drawing the illustrations, she worked with
her mother and father to publish the stories. <i>Cally and Bean: Middle
School Mysteries</i> is available in
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Cally-Bean-Middle-School-Mysteries-ebook/dp/B077W1MH1T">English</a>
and <a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/%E5%87%B1%E8%8E%89%E5%92%8C%E8%B1%86%E8%B1%86-Traditional-Jasmine-L-Psaris-ebook/dp/B08F6Z48RH">Traditional Chinese</a>.
The book is dedicated "For everyone in K8N" which is the pediatric
cancer ward on the North side of the 8th floor of Block K in Queen Mary Hospital.

### Taekwondo

Jasmine started taking Taekwondo lesson's 
at <a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.moks-tkd.com">Mok's Taekwondo School</a> 
under Kukkiwon Black Belt 9th Dan Grand Master Charles Mok in January 2010.  Prior 
to being diagnosed with cancer in 2014, Jasmine passed the 3rd Kup examination 
and btained a red stripe on her blue belt. After months of chemotherapy
and the removal of her right fibula she regained enough strength in
her leg to begin practice again.  By August 2015 she earned her red
belt and a year later -- one month before leaving Hong Kong for the
last time -- Jasmine passed the 1st Kup exam and proudly earned her
black stripe on September 24, 2016.

### Center for Talented Youth

Jasmine participated in <a class="my-link" target="_blank"
href="https://cty.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins Center for Talented
Youth</a> in November 2015.  By scoring in the 95th percentile for
quantitative skills, she qualified for participation in the CTY
programs -- both online and in person.  As her hair grew back and she
regained control of her right ankle, she proudly attended the 2016 <a
class="my-link" target="_blank"
href="https://educationdocbox.com/K_6_Educators/68850231-High-honors-students-2015-and-2016-united-states-of-america-international.html">award
ceremony</a>, walked on stage and accepted her award.

The following summer, Jasmine attended the newly created CTY Summer
camp in Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong.  She chose the Introduction to Robotics
course and spent the summer creating various robots with Lego
Mindstorms.  Her participation with the CTY program continued after
she moved back to New York.  She took advantage of their online
program and thoroughly enjoyed Scratch Programming for Middle School
Students.

## Fund Raising 

### St. Baldricks

Jasmine is a <a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/">St. Baldricks</a>
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/kids/jasminepsaris">honored kid</a>.  Since 2015,
over $130,000 has been raised for pediatric cancer research by
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/teams/jasmine">teams</a> shaving their heads
bald in Jasmine's honor. All funds raised by the events hosted at the
Hong Kong International School are donated to the Hong Kong Children's Cancer Foundation.

### MSK Kids

<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.mskcc.org/pediatrics">MSK Kids</a>
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.mskcc.org/pediatrics/experience/life-pediatrics">Child Life Services</a>
program brought Jasmine joy during her final year in New York.  Upon her death, an outpouring of support made 
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="http://mskcc.convio.net/goto/jasminepsaris">Jasmine's Giving Page</a> 
the <a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://secure2.convio.net/mskcc/site/TR/GivingPages/AnnualGiving;jsessionid=00000000.app20018a?pg=complist&fr_id=2903">top funded campaingn in 2017</a>.
Over $147,000 has been raised to support the MSK Kids Child Life Services program.  A
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbvJsB2oMcA">plaque</a> 
in Jasmine's memory has been placed in the main hall of 
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/nXhpdeKG6Mp87r8S6">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>.

### D10

Jasmine's fight caught the attention of four athletes competing in 
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://thed10.com/">the D10</a> to raise money for pediatric cancer
research.  After winning first place, they visited Jasmine at home and shared the good news and trophy.  The 
team renamed themselves "J's Bulls", and even though Jasmine passed away before the next year's event, 
they won first place again.  An 
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://thed10.com/blog/j-s-bulls-why-we-do-this-in-the-first-place">interview with the team</a> 
documents why they trained so hard.  Sadly, the team captain, 
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=618505401">Everett Cole Watson</a>, 
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href= "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw3NYc4By-g">passed away</a> as well,
leaving the team wondering if they should compete again.  The team renamed 
themselves "E-J's Bulls" in memory of Everett and Jasmine, dug deep, and 
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://thed10.com/blog/the-d10-nyc-2019-yearbook">won the competition</a> 
with the three remaining athletes.

## In Memory


### The Jasmine Psaris Art Award

<p>Jasmine filled her hours (and days) at the hospital playing [video]
games, reading books and creating art.  Even before Jasmine was
diagnosed with cancer, she showed a strong enthusiasm for art class.
Between ceramic sculptures, sketching and painting, she enjoyed the
process of designing and creating.  This passion became even stronger
when she could no longer attend class with her friends.  The
monotonous hospital hours were perfect for expressing herself through
art.  Jasmine created a vast <a class="my-link" href="portfolio">portfolio</a> of
stories and art.</p>

<p>In honor of Jasmine's love of art, the Jasmine Psaris Art Award was
created to recognize the 8th grade Hong Kong International School
student that most exemplifies a passion and talent for art.  Past
recipients of the Jasmine Psaris Art Award include:

<ul>
<li>Anna Kwan (2017/2018)</li>
<li>Tree Madden (2018/2019)</li>
<li>Emily Fan (2019/2020)</li>
<li><a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://hk.linkedin.com/in/janepoon1128">Jane Poon</a> (2020/2021)</li>
</ul>
</p>

### Jasmine Robot

<p>Hong Kong's <a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ccf.org.hk/en/">Children's Cancer Foundation</a>
provides caring services for young children with cancer as well as
their families.  A few examples include the donation of books, toys,
computers in the pediatric wards of government hospital. In addition,
they have donated cots for family members to sleep on when staying at
the hospital.  With the support of donations raised at Hong Kong
St. Baldricks events, the CCF funds pediatric cancer research with the
ultimate goal of eradicating the disease.</p>

<p>In appreciation for everything the CCF has achieved and in support of
all Hong Kong pediatric cancer patients, the Psaris family has donated
a self-driving, two-wheeled videoconferencing robot enabling patients
to visit other children and rooms of the hospital -- even when
confined to their beds.  The <a class="my-link" target="_blank"
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPSswmWUUPM">"Jasmine" robot</a>
became a surprise hit when Covid-19 prevented all in-person visits.</p>

### Dragon Tales

The <a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.hkis.edu.hk/">Hong Kong International School</a> "Dragon
Tales" publication honored Jasmine's time with the school by dedicating two pages for her in the 
<a class="my-link" target="_blank" href="https://issuu.com/hkisadvancement/docs/final_hkis_dt_winter17_web/94">winter 2017 issue</a>.
The article includes many pictures of Jasmine enjoying time with her friends and at school events.
