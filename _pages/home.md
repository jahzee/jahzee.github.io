## Jasmine Loves ... 


<details>

<h3 id="trixie">Trixie<a class="header-link" href="#trixie"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3>

Jasmine was a cat fanatic.  Between YouTube cat videos, cat
screensavers and wallpaper as well as a cat calendar, Jasmine could
not get enough cat exposure.  Unfortunately, Hong Kong doctors
indicated that her home should be pet and plant free during
chemotherapy treatments.  Bacteria associated with plants and pets
could bypass her compromised immune system and infect her body.

But once her surgery and chemotherapy treatments were complete,
Jasmine's first trip was to the <a href="https://www.spca.org.hk/en/">Hong Kong SPCA</a> to adopt a cat.  She
'interviewed' a few cats and settled on a domestic short-haired female
named Van.  Even though Van had one fang and a few molars removed by
the doctors and had a healing wound on her shoulder, her demeanor was
amiable.  Jasmine took Van home and rechristened her Trixie.

We will never know if Trixie was named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuffle_Bunny">Knuffle Bunny</a>'s owner or because
of all the tricks she played on us the first few days. Regardless of
the source, Trixie loved her new name and reciprocated the gift by
providing Jasmine with unconditional love and endless joy.

In November 2016, Trixie struggled through a 16-hour dark plane trip
from Hong Kong to be with Jasmine in New York.  For the next year,
Trixie was a shining light in Jasmine's struggle against cancer.
<a href="/trixie/">Trixie</a> continues to be a lasting gift from Jasmine to her
family.

<h3 id="scratch">Scratch<a class="header-link" href="#scratch"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3>

Jasmine enjoyed showing off her <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> coding skills to her classmates.  Her favorite creation was the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/27270597">Cat vs Mouse</a> game.  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/37947366/">Basketball Bonanza</a> is a lot of fun too.  Give them a shot and share your high score!

<h3 id="prezi">Prezi<a class="header-link" href="#prezi"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3>

Jasmine created many presentations with <a href="https://prezi.com">Prezi</a>.  She began 
with a <a href="https://prezi.com/b11vjggtgp-p/my-timeline/?present=1">timeline of her life</a> 
documenting her major milestones through April 2014.  In May, she made 
a <a href="https://prezi.com/1pwbj8k_kl-0/steve-jobs/?present=1">presentation about Steve Jobs</a>.  
After spending the first half of her 5th grade receiving treatment at 
<a href="https://www8.ha.org.hk/qmh/">Queen Mary Hospital</a>, she returned to school and designed another presentation 
about <a href="https://prezi.com/jazichaxl0uc/why-do-languages-become-extinct/?present=1">why some languages become extinct</a>.


<h3 id="cally-and-bean">Cally and Bean<a class="header-link" href="#cally-and-bean"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3>

To pass the time during chemotherapy treatments in 
<a href="https://www.ha.org.hk/qmh/">Queen Mary Hospital's</a>
<a href="https://paed.hku.hk/services/public_area/service/UPAM_K8_PE_001_Ward_Info.pdf">Children's Cancer Center</a>,
Jasmine enjoyed reading mystery novels.  Inspired to create her own,
she wrote three stories about best friends Cally and Bean (and a pet
hamster named Nams).  After drawing the illustrations, she worked with
her mother and father to publish the stories. <i>Cally and Bean: Middle
School Mysteries</i> is available in
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cally-Bean-Middle-School-Mysteries-ebook/dp/B077W1MH1T">English</a>
and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/%E5%87%B1%E8%8E%89%E5%92%8C%E8%B1%86%E8%B1%86-Traditional-Jasmine-L-Psaris-ebook/dp/B08F6Z48RH">Traditional Chinese</a>.
The book is dedicated "For everyone in K8N" which is the pediatric
cancer ward on the North side of the 8th floor of Block K.

<h3 id="taekwondo">Taekwondo<a class="header-link" href="#taekwondo"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3>

Jasmine started taking Taekwondo lesson's at <a href="http://www.moks-tkd.com">Mok's Taekwondo School</a> under 
Kukkiwon Black Belt 9th Dan Grand Master Charles Mok in January 2010.  Prior to being diagnosed
with cancer in 2014, Jasmine passed the 3rd Kup examination and
obtained a red stripe on her blue belt. After months of chemotherapy
and the removal of her right fibula she regained enough strength in
her leg to begin practice again.  By August 2015 she earned her red
belt and a year later -- one month before leaving Hong Kong for the
last time -- Jasmine passed the 1st Kup exam and proudly earned her
black stripe on September 24, 2016.

## Fund Raising 

<details>

<h3 id="st.-baldricks">St. Baldricks<a class="header-link" href="#st.-baldricks"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3>

Jasmine is a <a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/">St. Baldricks</a>
<a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/kids/jasminepsaris">honored kid</a>.  Since 2015,
over $130,000 has been raised for pediatric cancer research by
<a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/teams/jasmine">teams</a> shaving their heads
bald in Jasmine's honor. All funds raised by the events hosted at the
Hong Kong International School are donated to the <a href="#hk-ccf">Hong Kong Children's Cancer Foundation</a>.

<h3 id="msk-kids">MSK Kids<a class="header-link" href="#msk-kids"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3>

<a href="https://www.mskcc.org/pediatrics">MKS Kids</a>
<a href="https://www.mskcc.org/pediatrics/experience/life-pediatrics">Child Life Services</a>
program brought Jasmine joy during her final year in New York.  Upon
her death, an outpouring of support made <a href="http://mskcc.convio.net/goto/jasminepsaris">Jasmine's Giving Page</a> 
the <a href="https://secure2.convio.net/mskcc/site/TR/GivingPages/AnnualGiving;jsessionid=00000000.app20018a?pg=complist&fr_id=2903">top funded campaingn in 2017</a>.
Over $100,000 has been raised to support the MSK Kids Child Life Services program.  A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbvJsB2oMcA">plaque</a> in Jasmine's memory has been placed in the main hall of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nXhpdeKG6Mp87r8S6">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>.

<h3 id="d10">D10<a class="header-link" href="#d10"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3>

Jasmine's fight caught the attention of four athletes competing in <a href="https://thed10.com/">the D10</a> to raise money for pediatric cancer
research.  After winning first place, they visited Jasmine at home and shared the good news and trophy.  The team renamed themselves "J's Bulls", and even though Jasmine passed away before the next year's event, they won first place again.  An <a href="https://thed10.com/blog/j-s-bulls-why-we-do-this-in-the-first-place">interview with the team</a> documents why they trained so hard.  Sadly, the team captain, 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=618505401">Everett Cole Watson</a>, passed away as well, leaving the team wondering if they should compete again.  The team renamed themselves "E-J's Bulls" in memory of Everett and Jasmine, dug deep, and <a href="https://thed10.com/blog/the-d10-nyc-2019-yearbook">won the competition</a> with the three remaining athletes.

## In Memory


<details>
<summary>
<h3 id="hk-ccf">HK CCF<a class="header-link" href="#hk-ccf"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3>

Hong Kong's <a href="https://www.ccf.org.hk/en/">Children's Cancer Foundation</a>
provides caring services for young children with cancer as well as
their families.  A few examples include the donation of books, toys,
computers in the pediatric wards of government hospital. In addition,
they have donated cots for family members to sleep on when staying at
the hospital.  With the support of donations raised at Hong Kong
St. Baldricks events, the CCF funds pediatric cancer research with the
ultimate goal of eradicating the disease.  In appreciation for
everything the CCF has achieved and in support of all Hong Kong
pediatric cancer patients, the Psaris family has donated a
self-driving, two-wheeled videoconferencing robot enabling patients to
visit other children and rooms of the hospital -- even when confined
to their beds.  The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPSswmWUUPM">"Jasmine" robot</a> became a surprise
hit when Covid-19 prevented all in-person visits.

<h3 id="dragon-tales">Dragon Tales<a class="header-link" href="#dragon-tales"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a></h3>

The <a href="https://www.hkis.edu.hk/">Hong Kong International School</a> "Dragon
Tales" publication honored Jasmine's time with the school by
dedicating two pages for her in the <a href="https://issuu.com/hkisadvancement/docs/final_hkis_dt_winter17_web/94">winter 2017 issue</a>.
The article includes many pictures of Jasmine enjoying time with her friends and at school events.
